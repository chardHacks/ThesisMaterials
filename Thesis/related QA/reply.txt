Hi,

If it's alright with the rest of my teammates, then it's alright with me. However, if it happens that we all agreed, don't expect us to be in full participation with your research. Please consider that we are already working and we have little time to other things like interviews and etc. If you'll be asking a copy of our code, I can't help you with that because i don't have a copy. You would have to ask my other teammates or Ma'am Ria if they have a copy.

Thank you and good luck.

Sincerely,

John Nikole M. Pingco
